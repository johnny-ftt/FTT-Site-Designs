# Founder Images Setup

The About page (`about.html`) requires three founder images to be placed in the root directory:

## Required Images:

1. **founder-mark.jpg** - Photo of Dr. Mark Everard
2. **founder-johnny.jpg** - Photo of Johnny McMullan
3. **founder-koshul.jpg** - Photo of Koshul Naiden

## Image Specifications:

- **Format:** JPG
- **Dimensions:** Minimum 800x1000px (portrait orientation recommended)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 works best
- **File Size:** Optimized for web (under 500KB each)
- **Quality:** Professional headshots with good lighting

## Current Status:

The user has uploaded founder photos. These need to be saved to the following locations:

```
/home/user/FTT-Site-Designs/founder-mark.jpg
/home/user/FTT-Site-Designs/founder-johnny.jpg
/home/user/FTT-Site-Designs/founder-koshul.jpg
```

## Temporary Placeholders:

Until the actual founder images are added, you may want to use professional placeholder images from Unsplash or replace the img src attributes in about.html with temporary images.

## How to Add Images:

1. Save the three founder photos with the exact filenames above
2. Place them in the root directory of the project
3. Ensure they are optimized for web (you can use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
4. The about.html page will automatically display them

## Alternative: Using Unsplash

If you prefer to use Unsplash images temporarily:
