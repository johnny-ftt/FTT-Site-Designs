                        <h2>About This Role</h2>
                        <p class="large-text">This is a new kind of role that doesn't exist anywhere else. You'll sit at the intersection of sales and delivery, using our reusable Optimizely codebase and AI workflows to build production-realistic sites for prospects in 2-3 days—before they commit to anything. This isn't sales engineering. This isn't presales. This is building first, selling second. It's one of the highest-leverage positions in the company and central to proving our entire business model works.</p>

                        <h2>What You'll Do</h2>
                        <ul class="detailed-list">
                            <li>Transform prospect conversations into working sites—not presentations, actual functional prototypes running on Optimizely infrastructure in 2-3 days</li>
                            <li>Analyze brands, study competitors, understand requirements, and translate them into customized site experiences using AI-accelerated workflows</li>
                            <li>Use Claude and our proprietary AI systems to rapidly prototype client-specific functionality that would take traditional agencies weeks</li>
                            <li>Present real, working sites to prospects and iterate based on their feedback—showing proof, not promises</li>
                            <li>Collaborate directly with founders to refine our reusable patterns, AI workflows, and delivery approach based on what you learn from each build</li>
                            <li>Document what works, capture new patterns, and strengthen our foundation so each build makes the next one faster</li>
                            <li>Own the technical narrative in prospect conversations—you built it, you present it, you iterate on it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h2>What You Bring</h2>
                        <ul class="detailed-list">
                            <li>Strong technical foundation in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web development—you can read, understand, and extend complex codebases quickly</li>
                            <li>Experience with enterprise CMS platforms like Optimizely, Sitecore, Contentful, or similar—you understand content modeling, structured data, and how to build flexible systems</li>
                            <li>Proven ability to work effectively with AI coding assistants—you know how to prompt, when to trust the output, when to override it, and how to iterate quickly</li>
                            <li>Speed without sloppiness—you ship production-ready code fast because you understand what matters and what doesn't at different stages</li>
                            <li>Strong design sense and brand awareness—you can look at a company's existing digital presence and understand what their site should feel like</li>
                            <li>Client-facing communication skills—you can explain technical decisions, handle feedback gracefully, and guide conversations toward productive outcomes</li>
                            <li>Exceptional judgment—you know when to use AI, when to code manually, when to reuse existing patterns, and when to build something custom</li>
                            <li>Entrepreneurial mindset—you thrive in ambiguity, build systems that compound, and see opportunities where others see constraints</li>
                            <li>Curiosity about how AI changes development workflows—not just using it, but understanding how it shifts what's possible and how teams should work</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Ideal Background</h2>
                        <ul class="detailed-list">
                            <li>3+ years in web development with modern JavaScript frameworks</li>
                            <li>Experience building or customizing sites on enterprise platforms (Optimizely, Sitecore, Contentful, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Comfort with pre-sales, consulting, or client-facing technical roles</li>
                            <li>Track record of building quickly—hackathons, rapid prototyping, or agency work</li>
                            <li>Curiosity about AI and how it changes development workflows</li>

                        <h2>Why This Role Matters</h2>
                        <ul class="detailed-list">
                            <li>You're enabling a fundamentally new sales model that flips the traditional agency dynamic—from persuasion to proof, from promises to reality</li>
                            <li>Every site you build feeds back into our reusable foundation, making you faster and the entire company stronger</li>
                            <li>As our AI systems improve, this role becomes exponentially more leveraged—you'll be building in hours what takes others weeks</li>
                            <li>Direct, immediate impact on company growth—if we can't prove the model works at prospect stage, nothing else matters</li>
                            <li>You're creating a new category of work that will likely become standard across the industry in 2-3 years—be there first</li>
                        </ul>
